      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a security researcher, interested in understanding and addressing security problems in cyberspace.
My current research interests include Network Security, IoT Security, and Abuse Detection and Understanding.
Since June 2019, I have joined Facebook as a Research Scientist, working on various security projects such as Fuzzing, Proxy Detection, and Network Reputation Prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining Facebook, I had a four-year HAPPY ðŸ˜Ž research journey as a Ph.D. student at Indiana University (Go, Hoosiers!),
under the supervision of Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~fengqian/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Feng Qian&lt;/a&gt; and
Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XiaoFeng Wang&lt;/a&gt;.
And even before my Ph.D. study, I joined the fathers&amp;rsquo; association when my son was born in Feb 2015.
While it makes my Ph.D. study more challenging and stressful, life indeed becomes more enjoyable and meaningful for me.
&lt;!--&lt;span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;&gt;**Recently, I decide to seek a faculty or postdoc position, welcome to reach out!**&lt;/span&gt;--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
