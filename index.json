The focus is on the four upper layers of the popular five-layer TCP/IP model. In each layer, the state- of-the-art hardware and software technologies are introduced. These include, for example, DNS, HTTP, SMTP, and P2P systems at the application layer, TCP/UDP protocols at the transport layer, routing and forwarding, intra-domain and inter-domain routing algorithms at the network layer, random access protocols at the MAC layer, and local area networks (Ethernet and WiFi). Advanced topics such as multipath TCP and software defined networking are also briefly discussed.\nThe objective of the course is to enable students to\n gain fundamental knowledge of computer and telecommunications networks understand various tradeoffs and choices in current networking technologies learn basic network programming prepare for studying advanced topics (e.g. CSE 620, CSE 630, CSE 646), and a career in the field of computer networking.  At the end of this course, each student should be able to:\n Have a good overall picture of computer networking in general and the Internet in particular. Have a rough idea of how various networking components (hardware/software) work and where they belong in the 5-layer protocol stack. Know how to do network programming in C/C++ under Unix. Know how to do basic performance analysis of popular networking protocols. Know how to use popular networking tools such as WireShark and iperf. Start reading more advanced/research-oriented networking materials.  Pre-requisites Students need to have some basic knowledge of calculus and probability theory, data structures and algorithms (CSE 250 and either EAS 305 or MTH 411). In addition, they should be proficient in C or C++ programming.\nTextbooks  Highly recommended!, James F. F. Kurose and Keith W.

If the original scoring scale is 100, your late submission will get at most $100 * 0.9^x$ where x is the days after the deadline. When $x \\gt 7$, you get ZERO for your assignment.   Workload is heavy, so start early! Excuses that you did not have enough time for an assignment will not be considered. Extraordinary circumstances will be considered at the discretion of the instructor (not the TAs!), contact him if you think these apply to you.    Exams: If you miss an exam because of sickness or similar reasons, visit a physician and obtain a note detailing the period during which you were medically incapable of taking the exam. Notify the instructor immediately via e-mail or telephone (voice mail) if you are going to miss an exam, before the exam takes place unless medically impossible. See the instructor as soon as you return to class. If you miss an exam without a valid excuse, you will receive a zero grade for that exam. No make-up exam will be available without a valid excuse.\n  No extra work in the next semester will be given to improve your grade.\n  Regrading policy:\n Homeworks/WireShark Labs: Homework/Lab grades will be posted on UBLearns. You can pick grade homeworks/labs from the instructor\u0026rsquo;s office. Questions about homework/report grades should be sent by email to the TAs within one week after the grade is posted on UBLearns. If you are not satisfied with the TA\u0026rsquo;s response, you should contact the instructor no later than 3 days after the TA\u0026rsquo;s response. Programming assignments: Grades for the programming assignments will be posted on UBLearns. If you have questions about your grade, you should contact the TAs by email or during their office hours within one week after the grade is posted on UBLearns. If you are not satisfied with the TA\u0026rsquo;s response, you should contact the instructor no later than 3 days after the TA\u0026rsquo;s response. Exams: Exams will not be returned. Exam grades will be posted on UBLearns and you will be able to see your exam during the instructor\u0026rsquo;s office hours. If you have questions about your grade, you should contact the instructor by email or during office hours within one week after the grade is posted on UBLearns. No regrade requests will be considered after the deadlines mentioned above.  Academic Integrity   No tolerance on cheating!\n All academic integrity violation cases will be reported to the department, school, and university, and recorded. 0 in the particular assignment/exam if this is your first offense in any course. Fail the course on the second offense. Team members are equally responsible. Consult the Department and University Statements on Academic Integrity.    Group study/discussion is encouraged, but the submission must be your own work.\n  Homeworks/WireShark labs: Homeworks/lab reports must be written up individually or in teams of up to 3 students (highly recommended).

In addition to the classifier,new techniques have also been identified to capture RESIPs without interacting with and relaying traffic through RESIP services,which can significantly lower the cost and thus allow a continuous monitoring of RESIPs. Our RESIP service classifier has achieved a good performance with a recall of 99.7% and a precision of 97.6%in 10-fold cross validation. Applying the classifier has identified399 RESIP services, a much larger set compared to 38 RESIP services collected in all previous works. Our effort of RESIP capturing lead to a collection of 9,077,278 RESIP IPs (51.36% are located inChina), 96.70% of which are not covered in publicly available RESIP datasets. An extensive measurement on RESIPs and their services has uncovered a set of interesting findings as well as several security implications. Especially, 80.05% RESIP IPs located in China have sourced at least one malicious traffic flows during 2021, resulting in 52-million malicious traffic flows in total. And RESIPs have also been observed in corporation networks of 559 sensitive organizations including government agencies, education institutions and enterprises. Also, 3,232,698 China RESIP IPs have opened at least one TCP/UDP ports for accepting relaying requests, which incurs non-negligible security risks to the local network of RESIPs. Besides, 91% China RESIP IPs are of a lifetime less than 10 days while most China RESIP services show up a crest-trough pattern in terms of the daily active RESIPs across time.","tags":["Web Proxy","Cybercrime","Web Security","Network Security"],"title":"An Extensive Study of Residential Proxies in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siyuan Tang","Xianghang Mi","Ying Li","XiaoFeng Wang","Kai Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646956800,"objectID":"8a56a05dcbd03abdcda8d9a352571765","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/ccs22_sms_spam/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ccs22_sms_spam/","section":"publication","summary":"In this research project, up-to-date SMS spam campaigns are harvested by means of a continous and intelligent pipeline.

In the past decade, many successful take-down operations have been reported, including those against the Conficker worm, and most recently, against VPNFilter. Although it plays an important role in fighting cybercrime, the domain take-down procedure is still surprisingly opaque. There seems to be no in-depth understanding about how the take-down operation works and whether there is due diligence to ensure its security and reliability. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on domain takedown. Our study was made possible via a large collection of data, including various sinkhole feeds and blacklists, passive DNS data spanning six years, and historical WHOIS information. Over these datasets, we built a unique methodology that extensively used various reverse lookups and other data analysis techniques to address the challenges in identifying taken-down domains, sinkhole operators, and take-down durations. Applying the methodology on the data, we discovered over 620K takendown domains and conducted a longitudinal analysis on the take-down process, thus facilitating a better understanding of the operation and its weaknesses. We found that more than 14% of domains taken-down over the past ten months have been released back to the domain market and that some of the released domains have been repurchased by the malicious actor again before being captured and seized, either by the same or different sinkholes. In addition, we showed that the misconfiguration of DNS records corresponding to the sinkholed domains allowed us to hijack a domain that was seized by the FBI. Further, we found that expired sinkholes have caused the transfer of around 30K takendown domains whose traffic is now under the control of new owners.","tags":["Web Security","DNS"],"title":"Cracking the Wall of Confinement: Understanding and Analyzing Malicious Domain Take-downs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Wang","Xianghang Mi","Xiaojing Liao","XiaoFeng Wang","Kan Yuan","Feng Qian","Raheem A Beyah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519516800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519516800,"objectID":"4a6ba6dec92ac54eca86f12a274359d8","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/ndss18_search_autocomplete/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ndss18_search_autocomplete/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding and detecting manipulation of search engine autocomplete.","tags":["Web Security","Blackhat SEO"],"title":"Game of Missuggestions: Semantic Analysis of Search-Autocomplete Manipulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xianghang Mi","Feng Qian","Ying Zhang","Xiaofeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"667e7505b28be3020d2419e085122f68","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/imc17_ifttt/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/imc17_ifttt/","section":"publication","summary":"A comprehensive measurement of IFTTT, an IoT workflow platform, to reveal its network and security implications.","tags":["IoT Security","IoT","Network"],"title":"An Empirical Characterization of IFTTT: Ecosystem, Usage, and Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaolong Bai","Zhe Zhou","XiaoFeng Wang","Zhou Li","Xianghang Mi","Nan Zhang","Tongxin Li","Shi-Min Hu","Kehuan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502582400,"objectID":"f491bf7857dc0eda141f45bce5fe92f9","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/security17_offline_payment/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/security17_offline_payment/","section":"publication","summary":"Understand and mitigate synchronized token lifting and spending in mobile payment.","tags":["Mobile Security","Authenticaiton"],"title":"Picking Up My Tab: Understanding and Mitigating Synchronized Token Lifting and Spending in Mobile Payment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sumayah Alrwais","Xiaojing Liao","Xianghang Mi","Peng Wang","XiaoFeng Wang","Feng Qian","Raheem Beyah","Damon McCoy"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1495238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495238400,"objectID":"1856cfcca48702893f4ab60d3dd573e5","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/sp17_bulletproof_hosting/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sp17_bulletproof_hosting/","section":"publication","summary":"How can millions of residential IPs serve as traffic exits in commercial web proxy networks?","tags":["Network Security","Web Proxies","Cybercrime"],"title":"Under the shadow of sunshine: Understanding and detecting bulletproof hosting on legitimate service pr ovider networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nan Zhang","Soteris Demetriou","Xianghang Mi","Wenrui Diao","Kan Yuan","Peiyuan Zong","Feng Qian","XiaoFeng Wang","Kai Chen","Yuan Tian","Carl A Gunter","Kehuan Zhang","Patrick Tague","Yue-Hsun Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1492646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492646400,"objectID":"526a6f6151ea529823a3a6ba80a7ae5d","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/arxiv17_iot_sok/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arxiv17_iot_sok/","section":"publication","summary":"Inspired by the boom of the consumer IoT market, many device manufacturers, new start-up companies and technology behemoths have jumped into the space. Indeed, in a span of less than 5 years, we have experienced the manifestation of an array of solutions for the smart home, smart cities and even smart cars. Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoTs, come at the expense of privacy and security. Online and industry reports, and academic work have revealed a number of attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property loss and even large-scale availability problems on some of the most influential Internet services (e.g. Netflix, Twitter). To mitigate such threats, a few new solutions have been proposed. However, it is still less clear what are the impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoTs aiming to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move forward. To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related articles (papers, reports and news). Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them, the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further attention. We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas. We use this taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we define. Our assessment reveals that despite the acknowledged and growing concerns on IoT from both industry and academia, relevant security and privacy problems are far from solved. We discuss how each proposed solution can be applied to a problem area and highlight their strengths, assumptions and constraints. We stress the need for a security framework for IoT vendors and discuss the trend of shifting security liability to external or centralized entities. We also identify open research problems and provide suggestions towards a secure IoT ecosystem.","tags":["IoT Security"],"title":"Understanding iot security through the data crystal ball: Where we are now and where we are going to be","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xianghang Mi","Feng Qian","Xiaofeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"270dbe057819667477dc9544bdfd65b8","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/conext16_http2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conext16_http2/","section":"publication","summary":"HTTP/2 is quickly replacing HTTP/1.1, the protocol that supports the WWW for the past 17 years. However, HTTP/2’s connection management and multiplexing schemes often incur unexpected cross-layer interactions. In this paper, we propose SMig, an HTTP/2 extension that allows a client or server to migrate an on-going HTTP/2 stream from one connection to another. We demonstrate through real implementation that SMig can bring substantial performance improvement under certain common usage scenarios (e.g., up to 99% of download time reduction for small delay-sensitive objects when a concurrent large download is present).","tags":["HTTP2","Network"],"title":"SMig: Stream Migration Extension For HTTP/2","type":"publication"}]
