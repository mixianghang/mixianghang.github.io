In the past decade, many successful take-down operations have been reported, including those against the Conficker worm, and most recently, against VPNFilter. Although it plays an important role in fighting cybercrime, the domain take-down procedure is still surprisingly opaque. There seems to be no in-depth understanding about how the take-down operation works and whether there is due diligence to ensure its security and reliability. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on domain takedown. Our study was made possible via a large collection of data, including various sinkhole feeds and blacklists, passive DNS data spanning six years, and historical WHOIS information. Over these datasets, we built a unique methodology that extensively used various reverse lookups and other data analysis techniques to address the challenges in identifying taken-down domains, sinkhole operators, and take-down durations. Applying the methodology on the data, we discovered over 620K takendown domains and conducted a longitudinal analysis on the take-down process, thus facilitating a better understanding of the operation and its weaknesses. We found that more than 14% of domains taken-down over the past ten months have been released back to the domain market and that some of the released domains have been repurchased by the malicious actor again before being captured and seized, either by the same or different sinkholes. In addition, we showed that the misconfiguration of DNS records corresponding to the sinkholed domains allowed us to hijack a domain that was seized by the FBI. Further, we found that expired sinkholes have caused the transfer of around 30K takendown domains whose traffic is now under the control of new owners.","tags":["Web Security","DNS"],"title":"Cracking the Wall of Confinement: Understanding and Analyzing Malicious Domain Take-downs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Wang","Xianghang Mi","Xiaojing Liao","XiaoFeng Wang","Kan Yuan","Feng Qian","Raheem A Beyah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519516800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519516800,"objectID":"4a6ba6dec92ac54eca86f12a274359d8","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/ndss18_search_autocomplete/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ndss18_search_autocomplete/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding and detecting manipulation of search engine autocomplete.","tags":["Web Security","Blackhat SEO"],"title":"Game of Missuggestions: Semantic Analysis of Search-Autocomplete Manipulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xianghang Mi","Feng Qian","Ying Zhang","Xiaofeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"667e7505b28be3020d2419e085122f68","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/imc17_ifttt/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/imc17_ifttt/","section":"publication","summary":"A comprehensive measurement of IFTTT, an IoT workflow platform, to reveal its network and security implications.","tags":["IoT Security","IoT","Network"],"title":"An Empirical Characterization of IFTTT: Ecosystem, Usage, and Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaolong Bai","Zhe Zhou","XiaoFeng Wang","Zhou Li","Xianghang Mi","Nan Zhang","Tongxin Li","Shi-Min Hu","Kehuan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502582400,"objectID":"f491bf7857dc0eda141f45bce5fe92f9","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/security17_offline_payment/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/security17_offline_payment/","section":"publication","summary":"Understand and mitigate synchronized token lifting and spending in mobile payment.","tags":["Mobile Security","Authenticaiton"],"title":"Picking Up My Tab: Understanding and Mitigating Synchronized Token Lifting and Spending in Mobile Payment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sumayah Alrwais","Xiaojing Liao","Xianghang Mi","Peng Wang","XiaoFeng Wang","Feng Qian","Raheem Beyah","Damon McCoy"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1495238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495238400,"objectID":"1856cfcca48702893f4ab60d3dd573e5","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/sp17_bulletproof_hosting/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sp17_bulletproof_hosting/","section":"publication","summary":"How can millions of residential IPs serve as traffic exits in commercial web proxy networks?","tags":["Network Security","Web Proxies","Cybercrime"],"title":"Under the shadow of sunshine: Understanding and detecting bulletproof hosting on legitimate service pr ovider networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nan Zhang","Soteris Demetriou","Xianghang Mi","Wenrui Diao","Kan Yuan","Peiyuan Zong","Feng Qian","XiaoFeng Wang","Kai Chen","Yuan Tian","Carl A Gunter","Kehuan Zhang","Patrick Tague","Yue-Hsun Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1492646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492646400,"objectID":"526a6f6151ea529823a3a6ba80a7ae5d","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/arxiv17_iot_sok/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arxiv17_iot_sok/","section":"publication","summary":"Inspired by the boom of the consumer IoT market, many device manufacturers, new start-up companies and technology behemoths have jumped into the space. Indeed, in a span of less than 5 years, we have experienced the manifestation of an array of solutions for the smart home, smart cities and even smart cars. Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoTs, come at the expense of privacy and security. Online and industry reports, and academic work have revealed a number of attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property loss and even large-scale availability problems on some of the most influential Internet services (e.g. Netflix, Twitter). To mitigate such threats, a few new solutions have been proposed. However, it is still less clear what are the impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoTs aiming to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move forward. To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related articles (papers, reports and news). Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them, the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further attention. We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas. We use this taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we define. Our assessment reveals that despite the acknowledged and growing concerns on IoT from both industry and academia, relevant security and privacy problems are far from solved. We discuss how each proposed solution can be applied to a problem area and highlight their strengths, assumptions and constraints. We stress the need for a security framework for IoT vendors and discuss the trend of shifting security liability to external or centralized entities. We also identify open research problems and provide suggestions towards a secure IoT ecosystem.","tags":["IoT Security"],"title":"Understanding iot security through the data crystal ball: Where we are now and where we are going to be","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xianghang Mi","Feng Qian","Xiaofeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"270dbe057819667477dc9544bdfd65b8","permalink":"https://xianghang.me/publication/conext16_http2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conext16_http2/","section":"publication","summary":"HTTP/2 is quickly replacing HTTP/1.1, the protocol that supports the WWW for the past 17 years. However, HTTP/2’s connection management and multiplexing schemes often incur unexpected cross-layer interactions. In this paper, we propose SMig, an HTTP/2 extension that allows a client or server to migrate an on-going HTTP/2 stream from one connection to another. We demonstrate through real implementation that SMig can bring substantial performance improvement under certain common usage scenarios (e.g., up to 99% of download time reduction for small delay-sensitive objects when a concurrent large download is present).","tags":["HTTP2","Network"],"title":"SMig: Stream Migration Extension For HTTP/2","type":"publication"}]
